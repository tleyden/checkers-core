Core data structure and move generator for Checkers in golang.

I wanted to write a move generator, but did not want to use the data structures in checkers-bot, because they are clunky.

It's using similar data structures as found [here](http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes6/source/Checkers.java) which is from a [java book](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/s5.html).
